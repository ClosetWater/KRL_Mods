P("KeeperRL is a unique game that combines elements of both Rogue-like and Real Time Strategy genres. In KeeperRL, you take on the role of a dungeon keeper or other faction leader(s), tasked with marching out to conquer the world while also managing and defending your base from invading forces.")
P("")
P("The game is played from an overhead view and begins in real-time, without players taking individual turns to move. You can ask your minions to move, build rooms, and install various structures while a clock ticks away. KeeperRL allows you to control any of your minions (in a party or solo) whenever you want to, and controlling minions switches the gameplay from real-time strategy to Rogue-like gaming, which is turn based.")
P("")
P("Rogue-like gaming involves dungeon crawling through procedurally generated levels of enemy dungeons and settlements. The transition between the two modes is smooth, and all the object data remains the same, including tribes, monsters, weapons, armor, spells, furniture, and other object data. You can explore dungeon and terrain features in detail at a very low level and interact with the game features at this level of detail.")
P("")
P("One of the distinguishing features of KeeperRL is its permadeath system. If you lose a minion you are controlling, you have lost that minion for good. If you kill enemies, they are dead for good. If you lose your keeper character in either game mode, you have lost the game for good, and your save file will disappear to help you learn for next time.")
P("")
P("KeeperRL has a map that is 3 dimensional, meaning that you can dig out dungeons and build outside structures, but also dig down a vertical axis to create lower dungeon z-levels or build upwards into the hills of your biome.")
P("")
P("To master KeeperRL, you must manage and defend your dungeon from invaders, recruit additional minions, and take prisoners - and torture them to convert them. You must also develop technology as you defeat enemies and gather resources and loot equipment.")
P("")
P("While turns pass during control of a minion, your dungeon will continue to evolve if you are on the same map sector as your dungeon. You can control a team of minions and have them follow you, or break rank and chase enemies. In order to progress, you must go on the offensive, it often pays to control a balanced team, such as a healer, a spell caster, a warrior, and an archer, perhaps a flying creature to provide line-of-sight, creatures that can disarm enemy traps, riders, and steeds.")
P("")
P("If you want to focus on the RTS aspect, it's recommended to look at the possible technologies for each type of Keeper. The dungeon management is needed for recruiting, buffing, equipping, training, enslaving armies and solo heroes. Overwhelming enemeis in numbers with large armies and balanced ranged and melee abilities does have a huge advantage, but only on the open battlefield. Armies will self-organize themselves with melee fighters on the front line backed by ranged attackers behind them. The ranged or melee AI can be configured by the player for different minions.")
P("")
P("Aim to take out enemy ranged units with your melee and take out enemy melee with ranged attacks. Knights are often the procedural generated end-boss, and the elves should give you a bit of trouble. After that, it is retired dungeons of other players ranging from easier than knights to much, much tougher.")
P("")
P("In KeeperRL, your armies of monsters can get slaughtered by an overpowered defender positioned in fortifications or narrow corridors. Ambush points such as at the bottom of staircases are a big possibility. It is fairly common to wipe out the last retired dungeon, except for one legendary humanoid or cyclops that is holed up in a powerful defensive position, so you will need your roguelike strategies to solve these difficulties at some point and conquer the world.")
